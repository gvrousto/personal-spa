We created a new front end application in React and a backend application using Java Spring. As the lead, I helped groom the User Stories and provided guidance to my team members by engaging in paired programming sessions."

I spearheaded an initiative to automate our User Acceptance Tests as we developed our products. This greatly decreased our defects while testing, as well as incidents when we deployed to production; the benefits of this automation allowed us to create more code faster. As a result of my success in delivering reliable products, I was selected to be a part of a Test Driven Design (TDD) pilot program."

My team at Discover has come a long way in our Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery journey. We want to be releasing quality, tested code as quickly as we can and as often as we can. With that as our driving motivation I created a Universal Jenkins pipeline that can deploy any microservice. This allows us to create more functional code without being bogged down with DevOps."

These incidents occured in the legacy code base and required a code change to fix. During these experiences I learned how to diagnose the programming issue behind the incident and architect a solution with our business partners."

In order to analyze customer patterns more granularly, every page is filterable by time range, gender, and age demographic."

This initial exposure to the technology sector reaffirmed my passion for all things computing, and set me on my current path."
